# NMSSH

NMSSH is a clean, easy-to-use, unit tested framework for iOS and OSX that wraps libssh2.

Are you using NMSSH for something cool? [Let me know](http://twitter.com/Lejdborg).

## Installation

* Build the framework and add it to your project. Consult the Wiki for detailed information about how to [build for OSX](https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH/wiki/Build-and-use-in-your-OSX-project) or [build for iOS](https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH/wiki/Build-and-use-in-your-iOS-project).
* Add `#include <NMSSH/NMSSH.h>` to your source file.

## What does it look like?

```objc
NMSSHSession *session = [NMSSHSession connectToHost:@"127.0.0.1:22"
                                       withUsername:@"user"];

if (session.isConnected) {
    [session authenticateByPassword:@"pass"];

    if (session.isAuthorized) {
        NSLog(@"Authentication succeeded");
    }
}
    
NSError *error = nil;
NSString *response = [session.channel execute:@"ls -l /var/www/" error:&error];
NSLog(@"List of my sites: %@", response);
    
BOOL success = [session.channel uploadFile:@"~/index.html" to:@"/var/www/9muses.se/"];

[session disconnect];
```
